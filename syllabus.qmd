# Course Overview

This seminar explores how evidence generated from statistical research methods can be used to inform decision-making in academia, government, and industry. We will examine the merits and pitfalls of contemporary tools in experimentation and data science when it comes to policy evaluation or or justifying organizational change. We will learn that connecting evidence to decisions often requires additional language and argumentation, which will lead us to more advanced techniques designed specifically to inform decision-making with minimal assumptions.

## Topics

[HERE TABLE WITH LINKS TO EACH WEEK]

# Learning Objectives

- Understand how evidence drawn from statistical research methods can be used to inform decision-making in academia, government, and industry

- Acquire new language to engage in conversations about evidence-informed decision-making in a broad set of domains

- Practice discussing and writing about the application of new methods in quantitative and computational social science


# Requirements

POLI_SCI 210 or POLI_SCI 312 or equivalent experience with research design or data analysis.

# Required Reading

There is **no required textbook** for this course. Instead, readings for each are linked in the schedule below. All readings are available online for free or through university library subscription. 

**Readings are listed by intended reading order**

Readings for each week are divided by **theory** and **applications** of the methods, techniques, approaches, or issues we will discuss that week. In some weeks, we will discuss the theory first and applications second. In weeks in which the technical details are more dense, we will discuss applications first and theory second.

Since we are a small group, we can discuss division of labor arrangements to make sure that every reading is covered in extensive detail. You are still expected to be (at least) familiar with every assigned reading.

# Evaluation

Your final grade in this course will depend on the following: 

- Participation

- Discussion leading

- Discussion memos

- Final project: Pre-registration plan OR data exploration paper

# Grading

This course uses a labor-based grading agreement, commonly known as contract grading. In this course, instead of being given a final grade based on how “good” your submitted assignments are, your final grade will be based on the amount of work you put into the course. The goal is to decouple grades from performance and emphasize learning and effort.
